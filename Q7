Q7. Explain the sliding window technique and its use in string problems.  

The Sliding Window Algorithm is a technique used to efficiently solve problems that involve a window or range in the input data 
(arrays or strings) and then moving that window across the data to perform some operation within the window. 
It is used to reduce time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n) in problems dealing with contiguous subarrays or substrings.

It is commonly used in algorithms like finding subarrays with a specific sum, finding the longest substring with unique characters, 
or solving problems that require a fixed-size window to process elements efficiently

Uses in Strings:
- Substring without repeating characters
- Anagrams in a string
- Longest substring with at most k distinct characters
- Maximum vowels in a window
