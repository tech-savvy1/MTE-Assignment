Q1. Explain the concept of a prefix sum array and its applications. 

A Prefix Sum Array is an array where each element at index i is the sum of all elements from index 0 to i in the original array.

If arr[] = {a0, a1, a2, ..., an},
then:
prefix[0] = arr[0]
prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i] for i > 0

For an array [2, 4, 6, 8], the prefix sum array is [2, 6, 12, 20].

Applications:
- Efficient range sum queries.
- Subarray problems.
- Optimization in Dynamic Programming.
- Equilibrium index & partition checks.
